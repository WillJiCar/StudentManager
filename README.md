# StudentManager

This piece of software was completed as part of a software engineering module at University, it achieved a score of 94/100. The brief was to create a program that automatically sorted through a list of students based on grades and skills and assign them to teams. The main objective was to limit the amount of interaction needed from the user, this software only need 4 clicks from start to finish to import and sort the students into teams.
